## Summary

In this interactive session, participants are confronted with a policy challenge. In teams, they have to evaluate and present evidence on the impact of several policy options, applying the skills and tools they have learned in the previous sessions. Based on this, they develop an evaluation design to optimize findings on the desired and undesired effects of the policy and incorporate them into decisions in the policy-making process.
