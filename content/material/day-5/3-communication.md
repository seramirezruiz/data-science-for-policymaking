## Summary

In this series of two sessions, we focus on the various strategies for communicating data science. Topics include statistical communication, written communication, and interactive communication through dashboards, all aimed at effectively conveying complex data insights.

Building on this, we will cover reporting requirements and formats for different audiences. We will discuss how to present data to facilitate individual and institutional learning, ensure accessibility, and support the use of insights through clear recommendations and support mechanisms.
