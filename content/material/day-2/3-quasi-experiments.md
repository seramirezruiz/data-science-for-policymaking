## Summary

In this session, we will turn to three classic sins of statistical reasoning: (1) bad sampling and misconceptions of representativity, (2) bad analytics and misleading obsession with statistical significance, and (3) bad inference and confusing correlation with causation. We will discuss how to spot those flaws in the wild and how to address them.
